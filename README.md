Inquiry
===
---

Inquiry is an interactive visual tool developed within the [**Athanasius**](http://athanasius.stanford.edu) project. The main idea behind Inquiry is combining in a single tool the possibility to look at different dimensions of a data collection while filtering the collection. A hierarchical and dynamic filtering system can be defined by the user in order to better understand the collection and then deciding which portion of the collection focus on.


###Data model

Inquiry works on a single data collection (a JSON array of objects).

###Technology

From a technological point of view, Inquiry is a web application built with JavaScript ([d3](http://d3js.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) libraries).
