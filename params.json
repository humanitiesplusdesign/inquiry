The main idea behind Inquiry is combining in a single tool the possibility to look at different dimensions of a data collection while filtering the collection. A hierarchical and dynamic filtering system can be defined by the user in order to better understand the collection and then deciding which portion of the collection focus on.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Data model\r\n\r\nInquiry works on a single data collection (a JSON array of objects).\r\n\r\n###Technology\r\n\r\nFrom a technological point of view, Inquiry is a web application built with JavaScript ([d3](http://d3js.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) libraries).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
